Project Name: The Alien Abduction

This project is a virtual escape room that takes place on an alien spaceship. You (and your friends) must find out why you were taken here, and how to escape.

To play:
Go to the releases page (https://github.com/brokenfloppydisk/IDP-Group-2/releases) and download the latest release for your system. 
(note: only the windows version has an installer, for the rest, extract the .zip to its own folder and run )
For the webgl version, open index.html using a browser (Firefox is reccomended)

IMPORTANT:
If building from source, /Assets/Resources/DataDump/keys.json must be switched out for a real key. (The key pushed to github is no longer active)
