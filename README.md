# IDP-Group-2
Github repo for CAMS IDP group 2 (2020-21)

Project Name: TBD

This project is not yet finished, and is planned to be finished by the end of May.
The code is not very optimized (the duplicated animations for the title screen in the initial commit make this very clear),
as everyone in our group is still learning Unity.

This project is a virtual escape room, (and as of now) will be taking the form of a 2d point-and-click adventure game.
